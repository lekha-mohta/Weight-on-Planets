# Assignment 1: Weight Conversion and Gravity Effects

## Description
This Java program converts weights from pounds to kilograms and calculates equivalent weights on Earth and other planets based on gravity values read from a file.

## Program Features
1. Converts pounds to kilograms with precise formatting.
2. Reads gravity values from a `planets.txt` file.
3. Computes weights for Earth and two planets, displayed in a formatted table.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- `planets.txt` file in the same directory as the program.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   javac Assignment1.java
2. Run the program:
   java Assignment1

## Input File Format (`planets.txt`)
The file should contain two lines with gravity data, e.g.:
Jupiter's gravity is 2.53g
Mercury's gravity is 0.38g

## Output
- Converts weight from pounds to kilograms.
- Computes weights for Earth and other planets based on gravity.
- Outputs results in a formatted table.

## Example
Please type in a weight in pounds: 123
That is 55.792 kilograms

Jupiter's gravity is 2.53g
123 pounds on Earth weighs 55.7918 kilograms
123 pounds on Jupiter weighs 141.1533 kilograms

Earth        55.79
Jupiter     141.15
Mercury      21.20

## Notes
- Ensure proper formatting of the `planets.txt` file.
- Follow the exact input/output requirements for successful execution.
